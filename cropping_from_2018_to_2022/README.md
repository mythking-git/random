# [Skript Minecraft Plugin](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)

Skript is a Minecraft plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you do know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used for prototyping etc.

I've used Skript for many years and really enjoyed its simplistic language and readability.
